# MazeGames
Find your way through 2D and 3D mazes!

To play:
- Download files or clone the repository
- Use [Python](https://www.python.org/) to run the files
- for the 3D maze, the numpy and pygame modules are needed. You can install them using pip by typing "pip install numpy" and "pip install pygame" into the command line. If that doesn't work, you may need to [install pip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko9b_vC6XY0).
